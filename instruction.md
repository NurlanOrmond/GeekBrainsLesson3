# Instruction on how to work with GitHub

## How to download project from GitHub

* Create Folder
* Start VS Code
* Open Folder

 But we should not make git init by now, because git init is for local repository. We will work with remote rep.

* Go to Git Hub and copy reference of interested project. Use the code  button.

* VS Code > Terminal> git clone  and paste reference.

    By this we copy the remote repository to our local Folder.
    After that we can observe new copied folder under our Folder tree.
*  cd “name of Folder” 

   name is that has come from Git Hub.

*  cd "folder name"

   Initially we worked with local folder. cd move us inside folder that we have copied. We can check it out by git status.
